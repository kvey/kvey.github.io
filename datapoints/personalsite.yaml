    I've built this using Google's Angularjs.

    Posts are written in a markdown section of YAML files. As are these data objects.
    YAML is being used to wrap additional metadata such as tags, project association, and
    inter 'datapoint' linking.
    
    Markdown is parsed by Showdown and YAML is parsed by js-yaml.
