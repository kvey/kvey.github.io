  <h3> <a href="http://assembly.com"> Assembly (YCS15)</a> - CTO: </h3>
  <p>2014-2018: GetScale became Assembly. Fulfillment, Sourcing, and Process Control</p>
  <div class="section">
    <p>
      From 2014 to 2018 I led an international team of engineers in Redwood
      City, CA and Shanghai, China. I established engineering practices,
      procedures, security practices and devops systems. I participated in
      hiring and firing, building company culture, and worked with sales and
      operations. Both participating in and eventually leaving Assembly were
      some of the hardest things I've ever done. I'm grateful for everyone I
      ever had the opprotunity to work with there and to my co-founder Jonathan
      for all of their hard work and support throughout the experience.

      <b>mDNS based local peer discovery and Console Network - 2017</b>
      <br/>
      * This enabled our consoles to communicate internally within a client facility.
      We needed to allow consoles further down an assembly line to be notified
      when they encountered units that had failed particular criteria. This needed to
      happen while it was possible that the consoles would not be able to
      communicate out of the facility.
      <br/>
      * Consoles would broadcast over mDNS, perform leader election, and replicate
      their logs across one another. Locally clients would query their log for the
      state of units the network had encountered. Consoles would display
      notifications when they had lost connection to the network or were otherwise
      trailing behind the shared log of the network.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Source controlled Devops - 2017</b>
      <br/>
      * We imposed a requirement that all of our developer operational tools
      exist and be documented in our source repository. This allowed any of our
      engineers to view our current configuration and allowed auditable
      management of changes to our infrastructure. Our infrastructure was
      managed as kubernetes clusters in China and the US on separate cloud
      providers, defined using initially CloudFormation in a clojure DSL and
      then Terraform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Warehouse Service Sales and Support - 2017</b>
      <br/>
      * With the addition of warehousing services in the US in 2017 I managed the
      migration and handover of multiple warehousing clients to our service as we
      acquired the customer base of another organization.
      <br/>
      * I particpated in sales and support calls both solo and with the support of
      our team with new and existing customers.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Support for operating in bandwidth limited environments - 2016</b>
      <br/>
      * Our customers were located in rural locations with hard bandwidth
      limitations. For this reason our collection of video and image data
      required support of bandwidth utiliziation tracking, and compression on
      locally installed edge services. Our systems were collecting extremely
      similar imagery from unit to unit and we exploited this feature by
      pre-training our compression libraries against these baselines and by
      shipping differences rather than whole resources.
      <br/>
      * Downloads of updates to the procedures and software included on our
      consoles similarly used binary differences in their payloads rather than
      re-downloading full copies of their resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LCD Character Recognition - 2016</b>
      <br/>
      * In order to better instrument less sophisticated final assembly and QA
      processes we built a system for running optical character recognititon on
      liquid crystal displays commonly used on scales, calipers, and other
      existing equipment. This was implemented using Tesseract and OpenCV.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>QR Code scanning performance - 2016</b>
      <br/>
      * Efficient QR Code scanning became critical to our operations as our
      systems moved into manufacturing process control and quality assurance. We
      produced internal software systems for faster qr decoding, camera focus, and
      zoom. We also customized our hardware: our camera lenses, added rangefinding and
      programmable lighting.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Log ingestion and transport - 2016</b>
      <br/>
      * This system ingested terabytes of data per day of temperature,
      orientation, and behavior information from our consoles installed in the
      field. Collecting and analyzing this data for online analysis and alerting
      of process behavior and offline analysis of factory conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Event sourcing model with reactive queries - 2015</b>
      <br/>
      * To improve developer productivity and better support collaboration between
      international teams we moved our console management infrastructure to an
      eventually consistent event sourcing model. On the client we allowed
      queries to be defined in datascript and on the backend our configurations
      were stored in Datomic.
      <br/>
      * This allowed us to use not only a single
      programming language (clojure/clojurescript) but a single query language
      (datalog). All events dispatched on the client were handled on the server
      in the same format and propagated to clients subscribed to those queries,
      code for this system was shared on the client and server. Both the client
      and server were operating over a normalized representation of the data in
      a datalog database, where the client represented that user's accessible
      subset of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Delay tolerant networking infrastructure - 2015</b>
      <br/>
      * Our system was deployed into factories in rural locations, in locations
      with constraints on access particular internet services. We provided a
      service that managed multiple hops between different and particular
      geographically located infrastructure providers and would queue all
      intermediate data for reliable delivery.

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      <b>Prototype Quality Control system - 2014</b>
      <br/>
      * Our team designed and built semi-custom touchscreen terminals and
      camera/sensor packages that were deployed into factories in China and
      the US. These systems were used to perform data collection during quality
      control processes. We acquired an initial group of customers and built a
      rudimentary system for managing the procedures displayed on the consoles
      that could be managed from the US.
      <br/>
      * We applied to and were accepted into Y Combinator for their Summer 2015
      batch based on this system.

      <b>Bill of Materials Optimization - 2014</b>
      <br/>
      * This allowed users to visualize the pricing of their bill of materials
      at varying production quantities and then select appropriate quotations
      from multiple vendors for pricing optimization at that target quantity.
      We accounted for break bulk, minimum order quantities and unit
      quotations and allowed users to interactively adjust part selections and
      target quantities.
      <br/>
      * The backend of this system was initially implemented in C and then later converted
      to multithreaded Clojure as we extended support to a larger variety of suppliers.
      <br/>
      * The frontend of this was implemented in ClojureScript and allowed
      interactive zooming and exploration of the dataset across all parts in
      the BoM.

      <b>Product Lifecycle Management system - 2014</b>
      <br/>
      * The initial product we developed at GetScale was a PLM or Product Lifecycle Management system.
      We provided a user interface for hierarchical bill of material management, version control, and
      automated part quotation.

      We provided a browser based interface for visualizing and iterating on designs
      and a version control system for collaboration.
