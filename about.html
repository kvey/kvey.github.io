  <ul>
    <li>
      Prototype Quality Control system
      <br/>
      * Our team designed and built semi-custom touchscreen terminals and
        camera/sensor packages that were deployed into factories in China and
        the US. These systems were used to data collection during quality
        control processes. We acquired an initial group of customers and built a
        rudimentary system for managing the procedures displayed on the consoles
        that could be managed from the US.
      <br/>
      * We applied to and were accepted into Y Combinator for their Summer 2015
        batch based on this system.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bill of Materials Optimization
      <br/>
      * This allowed users to visualize the pricing of their bill of materials
        at varying production quantities and then select appropriate quotations
        from multiple vendors for pricing optimization at that target quantity.
        We accounted for break bulk, minimum order quantities and unit
        quotations and allowed users to interactively adjust part selections and
        target quantities.
      * The backend of this system was initially implemented in C and then later converted
        to multithreaded Clojure as we extended support to a larger variety of suppliers.
      * The frontend of this was implemented in ClojureScript and allowed
        interactive zooming and exploration of the dataset across all parts in
        the BoM.

    <li>
      Product Lifecycle Management system
      <br/>
      * The initial product we developed at GetScale was a PLM or Product Lifecycle Management system.
        We provided a user interface for hierarchical bill of material management, version control, and
        automated part quotation.

    <li>
      Library managemnt
      <br/>
      * Worked with CEO and designer to re-design and implement a new library management
        interface. Libraries in this context are collections of footprints and
        symbols used by electrical engineers in their designs.

    <li>
      Footprint/symbol editor
      <br/>
      * This allowed users to use Javascript and a small DSL to define and modify
        symbols and footprints for use in the design of printed circuit boards (PCBs).
        We provided a browser based interface for visualizing and iterating on designs
        and a version control system for collaboration.
