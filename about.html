    <b>Prototype Quality Control system</b>
    <br/>
    * Our team designed and built semi-custom touchscreen terminals and
    camera/sensor packages that were deployed into factories in China and
    the US. These systems were used to perform data collection during quality
    control processes. We acquired an initial group of customers and built a
    rudimentary system for managing the procedures displayed on the consoles
    that could be managed from the US.
    <br/>
    * We applied to and were accepted into Y Combinator for their Summer 2015
    batch based on this system.

    <b>Bill of Materials Optimization</b>
    <br/>
    * This allowed users to visualize the pricing of their bill of materials
    at varying production quantities and then select appropriate quotations
    from multiple vendors for pricing optimization at that target quantity.
    We accounted for break bulk, minimum order quantities and unit
    quotations and allowed users to interactively adjust part selections and
    target quantities.
    * The backend of this system was initially implemented in C and then later converted
    to multithreaded Clojure as we extended support to a larger variety of suppliers.
    * The frontend of this was implemented in ClojureScript and allowed
    interactive zooming and exploration of the dataset across all parts in
    the BoM.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Product Lifecycle Management system</b>
    <br/>
    * The initial product we developed at GetScale was a PLM or Product Lifecycle Management system.
    We provided a user interface for hierarchical bill of material management, version control, and
    automated part quotation.

  <p>2013-2014: Small volume electronics manufacturing</p>
  <p>
    <b>Library managemnt</b>
    <br/>
    * Worked with CEO and designer to re-design and implement a new library management
    interface. Libraries in this context are collections of footprints and
    symbols used by electrical engineers in their designs.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Footprint/symbol editor</b>
    <br/>
    * This allowed users to use Javascript and a small DSL to define and modify
    symbols and footprints for use in the design of printed circuit boards (PCBs).
    We provided a browser based interface for visualizing and iterating on designs
    and a version control system for collaboration.
