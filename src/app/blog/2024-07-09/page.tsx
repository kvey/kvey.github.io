                I believe engineering is fundamentally about people. I care about how you feel, satisfaction, mental
                state and well being. Happy, focused, and driven people are the most productive, best to work with and
                they help one another do their best work.
              </li>
              <li className={"ml-8"}>
                I believe in essence and getting to the heart of things, reuse and systems thinking. I enjoy debugging,
                understanding, building mental models and getting to the root of issues. I will find joy in building
                these models with you and be excited when I see you do the same.
              </li>
              <li className={"ml-8"}>
                I believe in bias to action. Our best option is to keep learning, explore the environment, and reduce
                unknowns. Action will short circuit debate and I believe thatâ€™s the correct tradeoff. I would rather we
                do something 50% wrong but learn something than wait and do something perfectly after a significant
                delay. I believe incremental change and course correction is more effective than initial precision.
